Connecting data since 2009

## About
We are a 100% employee owned company, formed in 2009. We’re an alumnus of the business incubator and enterprise partnership [SetSquared](https://www.setsquared.co.uk/). We’ve grown from that small base as a tech start-up to an exciting, innovative tech scale-up company close to Bristol in south west England.   

We are at the forefront of developing standards, tools and applications, working with organisations to integrate, organise, manage, publish and use data.  We help organisations connect data, making more effective use of your data assets through open, standards-based linked data tools and techniques. 

Our website is **www.epimorphics.com** and an overview of the team can be found here: **www.epimorphics.com/about**

## How we work
We work with clients on projects from beginning to end, to develop effective strategies that make better sense and use of their data. 

For data strategy development and architecture projects we help you understand needs, develop strategies and then implement them.

For more hands-on data projects you can be assured that our expertise in user-experience design, data design, manipulation and management, and our depth of experience in software development will deliver good digital service design and excellent approaches that make the most of your data. 

We design, build and run data services, licence technology and provide other related consultancy services.  Our purpose is to help you make the most of your data, creating apps and data visualisations designed to deliver information into the hands of those who need it. Make better business decisions with the insight provided by the new clarity of the existing data.

There are many examples of our work and case studies here: [www.epimorphics.com/projects](https://www.epimorphics.com/projects) and we post `#TechTalks` and other articles on our blog here: [www.epimorphics.com/blog](https://www.epimorphics.com/blog)
